# View Planning Library 1.0

> Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog√≠a (CONACyT)


Currently this is a project where I will rebuild the view planning project as simple as possible.

The target is to provide view view planning methods to be used in machine learning algorithms.

Since many of the current libraries for 3D perception are build in C++ I will use it as base and the I will add compatibility to Python.

If your want to contribute please drop me a mail:
